In the [previous post](/read/beginning-dev-ops-day-3), I talked about the integrated services in aws.

## Today

I have finally understood why people say Jenkins is hard and stressful. I mean HOW DID I SPEND SO MANY HOURS CONFIGURING BUILDS AND ONE DIDN'T EVEN WORK ?

Yeah, I know I'm just starting out but omo, no be here. I'll go and learn how to work with Travis CI, GitHub actions, Azure DevOps and Gitlab CI etc.

---

So basically, today was about learning what Continuous Integration is all about. CI has to do with engaging a particular build of an app or software in series of tests, builds itself, compilations and static code analysis. 

The book I'm currently reading focused on Jenkins. It is a CI tool, I installed it and created a new job that passed a build. Jenkis also allows the integration of plugins to test code quality and statically carry out code analysis ( SonarQube).

I was unable to integrate the static code analysis plugin to work well in Jenkins, I've left it alone. Maybe some other time in the future.

## Challenges

The book I was reading wasn't detailed enough for a beginner, however, as a result, I was able to learn more by googling. I had many issues fixing the build, but it was fun all through.

I also had issues installing SonarQube ( and Postgres majorly ) but [this article](https://techexpert.tips/sonarqube/sonarqube-installation-ubuntu-linux/) was very helpful. Upon all my wahala, it didn't work for the build, but WE MOVE!.

## Tomorrow,

I'll be looking into the container section of the book where I'll be introduced to Docker and maybe other ones. I'll also try to study on other CI tools, I have tried Travis before, so I believe the others should be easier than Jenkins.


Until then, if you were here, drop a comment.
